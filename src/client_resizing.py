"""Client window resizing — freeform, crisp, undistorted game-window resizing.

Pieces (Deimos runs out-of-process, but uses WizWalker's in-process asm hooks for
the one thing cross-process can't do — forcing the render backbuffer):

1. Window (ctypes): add a sizing border (WS_THICKFRAME) so the game window can be
   drag-resized. (A fat WM_NCHITTEST grab zone would need a WndProc subclass, which
   is process-local; the native border still works — grab right at the edge.)

2. Backbuffer (WizWalker asm hook — wizsprinter ResolutionForcer): on resize, force
   the D3D backbuffer to the new client size so the render is crisp (not stretched)
   AND so mouse/UI hit-testing stays correct (the game maps clicks against the
   backbuffer; a backbuffer != client mismatch offsets every click). We therefore
   keep window-client == backbuffer at all times.

3. Camera aspect (WizWalker memory): the 3D projection aspect comes from the engine
   view frustum, not the backbuffer, so we widen the CamView frustum to match the
   window aspect (keeping vertical FOV) → world fills any aspect undistorted.

On a drag (debounced to the final size): force backbuffer = WxH, re-assert the
window client to WxH (the engine's apply snaps the window to its old size), then
correct the frustum aspect. If the asm hook is unavailable/fails, it degrades to
resize + aspect-correct (render scales) without crashing.
